# Algorithm I developed to solve the multi-armed bandit problem. 

Balanced to exploit trends, while still exploring new options. Won me first place :)

This solves issues that appear when there are multiple options to choose but you have limited resources and rewards from the options change.

Examples:
- AB testing for websites
- Choosing advertisements
- Slot machines (As done in this example)
